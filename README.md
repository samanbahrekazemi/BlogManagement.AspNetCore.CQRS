# <div>Blog Management Asp.net Core 6 CQRS & MediatR</div>

BlogManagement.AspNetCore.CQRS is a sample project that showcases how to implement the CQRS pattern in an ASP.NET Core application. The project demonstrates how to separate the write and read models using a command and query responsibility segregation (CQRS) approach, and uses MediatR for command and query dispatching. It includes a sample implementation of a RESTful API that can be used as a reference for building scalable and maintainable blog management systems. Use this project to learn best practices for implementing CQRS with ASP.NET Core and building enterprise-grade applications. ðŸš€
